### Post answers (and links to where you found them) for each of the questions below:

1. Can we use `npm` with React or do we have to use `yarn`?
 - We _can_ use npm.

2. We are using JSX to write HTML inside of our React. Are we required to use JSX with React? Are there any alternatives?
 - We can also use `React.createElement()`

3. Does React re-render the entire component when one part of it changes?
 - No; it updates a 'virtual DOM'.

4. Should we ever change `props` (or parameters) inside of a component? 
 - No. Components should act like pure functions.

    1. bubbles
    2. cancelable

    3. `constructor()`
